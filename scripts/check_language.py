"""Fail if Cyrillic appears anywhere outside a language place.

The project language is English. Russian and Ukrainian live only in their own places, on par with
every other language:

  * a path part named after the language: `ru/`, `uk/` (`tests/fixtures/ru/`, ...);
  * a file named for the language: `README.ru.md`, `lang/ru.json`, `lang/uk.json`;
  * the self-names of the two languages in a list where every language is named in its own way
    (`English · Español · Português · <Russian> · <Ukrainian>`, each in its own script).

Every file under the plugin folder is checked - each part of its path, and its text - walked on the
disk, not asked from git: this plugin may sit inside another repository (or none) while it is built,
and a git listing there would be empty and silently green. There are no in-file exemption markers -
the list above is the whole list.
